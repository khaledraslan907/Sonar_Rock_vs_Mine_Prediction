## Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction ##
## This project involves creating a logistic regression model to classify whether sonar signals represent rocks or mines. The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ##
## Steps Involved:
## 1- Loading the Dataset:
The dataset is loaded using the pandas library.
## 2- Describing the Data:
Basic statistical details of the dataset are obtained using the describe() function. This helps in understanding the distribution, mean, and other statistical parameters of the dataset.
## 3- Splitting the Data:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. This is done using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library.
## 4- Creating the Model:
A logistic regression model is created using the sklearn library. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
